Mash

Steep
-----

Got water to 170

Added specialty grains and pumpkin. Unfortunately 1.5 gallon of water doesn't
cover the grain bag so I had to do some squishing to get it spread out.

Started timer for one hour. Will check temp after 15 min.

May consider adding a little more water to cover grain bag at a minimum but
maybe it'll spread out.

Left a little pumpkin in the bowl and a little went straight into the kettle.

Checked after about 15 min and huge temp drop around 120. Started the burner
again to try and maintain heat. Getting back to temp now.

Hard to maintain with heat. Ended up near 170 again before just cutting heat and
putting lid on.

Pulled grain and pumpkin bag out at 60 min and put in a colander over a bucket.
Poured 1 gallon of 160 water over and let drain.  Pumpkin and grains were in
separate bags.

Boil
----

Added 4.5 gallons of water. Tough to tell with no volume markers bit I want to
boil 6.5 gallons and I assume a loss of about a half gallon to grains.

Brought to a boil.

Killed heat and Added 6.6 lbs of cbw Pilsen light LME and stirred it in. Turned
flame on and brought to a boil.

Boil started added 1 oz of fuggle hops Stirred to keep from boiling over.
Started 60 min timer.

With 15 min left added the final hops and wort chiller and spoon.  Returned to a
boil after adding chiller.

Turned flame off and added spices when buzzer went off. Stirred for a minute in
the middle of the wort chiller. Let sit for 15 min.

Connected wort chiller and added thermometer as cold water started flowing.
Waiting for 68 to move to carboy.

Racked into carboy and Aerated for about 4 minutes. Grabbed a sample for
testing. Moving carboy to basement to pitch.  Looks like 1.053 at about 75 F.
Pitched yeast at about 74 f.

Added airlock. Time to wait!

Ferment
-------

Took sample and replaced airlock. Measured Gravity at about 1.019. Temperature
is about 64.

Serve
-----

Tapped keg this morning (12/6).  Has an interesting opening taste but overall I
think solid.  I seem to remember the actual bottle of Post Rd. I've had in the
past having a flavor that I did not really expect.
