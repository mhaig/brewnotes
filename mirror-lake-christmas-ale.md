Notes
=====

Mash
----

With 12.33 lbs of grain and an estimated boil off of 1.5 gallons per hour,
starting with 7.75 gallons of water.

Added grains at 166 with gas off and stirred.

Checked at 15 min. Temp was at 162. Stirred for a bit. Before putting lid temp
was around 158.

Checked at 30 min. Temp was at 158.  Stirred. Before putting lid temp was around
152.

Checked a little late at 8 min. Temp was a little above 150. Stirred. Temp was a
little below 150 before putting lid back on.

Ended at about 148. Firing burner now.

Hit 170. Turned heat off and let sit for at least 12 min. Pulled the bag out
into a bucket to drain for a bit and then put liquid in bucket into kettle.

Grabbed a sample at this point but forgot to stir first.

Boil
----

Fired up burner to start boil. Dumped sample back and took another one after
stirring. May have broken my sample tube. Started cracking.

Now awaiting boil.

Boil started. Added 1 oz Cascade. Two expired cinnamon sticks and 1 oz of coarse
chopped ginger. Stirred and started timer.

Added 3 oz of Hallertauer hops with 10 minutes left and dropped wort chiller in
as well.

Flame off and honey added after 60 min boil. Started cold water flow and dropped
in thermometer.  Left spoon in as well to stir while cooling.

Pre boil Gravity 1.054 at room temperature (68)

Cooled to below 80 and transferred to carboy. Ended up with a little less than 5
gallons, not bad!

Aerated for 1.5 minutes and took a sample. Pitched yeast at about 75.  Read
about 1.072!

Nestled in basement with a blanket to ferment.

Ferment
-------

Fermented quick but got up to around 80 and had slowed down after a day and a
half so I moved it into the front closet.  Then got down a bit below 64 so I
moved it out but near door. Still bubbling a bit and holding around 68. Still
watching due to cold weather.

Transfer to secondary. Measured Gravity at 1.018.  About 64 deg.
Tastes really good!

Serve
-----

Tapped keg this morning (12/6).  Tastes good, no sweet after-taste like my
previous beers.  Decent head which is good.  Smells really good, can really pick
up the ginger.  Strong taste as well, can tell there's some alcohol in it.  Has
a little sediment in the glass but this is the first pour from the bottom.  Will
take a picture to document at the competition.
